# Raavana

Raavanaa is a digital platform that helps students build smart profiles, makes it easy for colleges to manage recruitment activities, and gives recruiters a clear view of candidates’ real skills.

It’s not just about resumes. It’s about skills, growth, and connecting the right people together.

The platform is made up of three main parts:

-	For colleges (Admin)
-	For students (Candidates)
-	For companies (Recruiters)

## Why we are Building Raavana?

In today’s world, students are learning many things beyond what’s in their textbooks. But a traditional resume doesn’t always show that.

Colleges are trying to help their students grow, but there’s no simple way to manage everything in one place. Recruiters want to hire the right talent, but it’s hard to know what a student is truly capable of just by reading a resume.

Raavana brings everyone together and makes it easier to see, grow, and connect through real skills.
